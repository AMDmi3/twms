In jurisdictions which recognise Public Domain property, the user of this

the conditions of the ISC License (see below), or 3) under the terms of
dual Public Domain/ISC License conditions described here, as they choose.

The ISC License is compatible with both the copyleft and proprietary
software, being as close to Public Domain as possible with the minor
nuisance of being required to keep this copyright notice and license
text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the Public Domain
"license" you can re-license your copy using whatever license you like.
